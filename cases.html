        <h3>This page highlights some of the most emblematic cases of forced disappearances in Mexico. Stories that demand to be remembered, voices that refuse  to be silenced.<br />From students to journalists, from entire families to single activists, each case represents a painful truth: forced disappearance is not a thing of the past, but a wound that continues to bleed more than ever in Mexico. </h3>

            <h2>Ayotzinapa</h2>
            <h3><em>Iguala, Guerrero</em>, September 26, 2024</h3>
            <p>This case involves the forced disappearance of 43 male students from the <em>Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa</em>, an educational institution known for activism. <br> The <strong>parts involved</strong>are the local police, who intercepted the students (alegedly by order of the mayor of Iguala) and the criminal group <em>Guerreros Unidos</em>. <br/> The Federal forces and the military were reportedly aware of the events and may have been complicit.</p>

            <h2>San Fernando Massacres</h2>
            <h3><em>San Fernando, Tamaulipas</em>, between 2010 and 2011</h3>
            <p><strong>August 2010</strong> <br/> The bodies of 72 migrants (58 men and 14 women) were found executed on a ranch. Most were Central and South American migrants en route to the U.S. <br/> <strong>April 2011</strong><br/>Authorities discovered mass graves containing 193 more bodies, believed to be passengers kidnapped from buses by the cartel.<br/> This case involves the Zetas drug cartel, one of the most violent crime organizations in Mexico. <br/> The victims were undocumented migrants and mexican nationals. Survivors' testimones revealed complicity or inaction by local police and authorities.</p>

            <h2>Cadereyta Massacre</h2>
            <h3><em>Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León</em> (northern Mexico), 2012</h3>
            <p><strong>May 13 of 2013 </strong> <br/> The decapitated and mutilated bodies of 49 people were found dumped on a highway. The victims had been beheaded, their hands and feet cut off, and their bodies left in plastic bags. <br/> he massacre was initially attributed to the Zetas cartel, which was engaged in a violent conflict with the Gulf Cartel and other rivals at the time. The gruesome display was likely intended as a message of intimidation in the context of territorial disputes.<br/> The Cadereyta massacre is one of the most visibly brutal acts of the Mexican drug war. It exposed the extent of dehumanization used as a tool of control and terror. It also reflected how forced disappearances often turn into mass killings.<br/> Although some suspects were arrested, no full truth or justice has been delivered. The case remains a symbol of impunity, and the identities and stories of the victims have largely been erased from public memory. </p>

            <h2>Jalisco Extermination Camp (Izaguirre Ranch)</h2>
            <h3><em>Teuchitlán, Jalisco</em> 2025</h3>
            <p><strong>March 2025 </strong> <br/> The activist group Buscadores Guerreros de Jalisco (Warrior Searchers of Jalisco) discovered a site containing:</p>
            <p>Three clandestine crematoriums<br/>
                Charred human remains, including skulls and teeth<br/>
                Over 200 pairs of shoes<br/>
                Hundreds of personal items such as clothing and backpacks<br/>
                Farewell letters and shell casings<br/>
            </p>
            <p>These findings suggest the site was used for mass killings and body disposal, leading to its characterization as an "extermination camp". <br/> he Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) is believed to have operated this site. Survivor testimonies indicate that individuals were lured with false job offers, then subjected to forced recruitment, brutal training, and, in many cases, execution .</p>
